## üë§ About Me  

- **Name:** Oh Jaehong (Ïò§Ïû¨Ìôç)  
- **Birthdate:** July 8, 1999  
- **Affiliation:** School of Mechanical Engineering, Soongsil University  
- **Current Role:** Robotics & Control Engineer, AI Researcher  

### üåü Research Vision  

My research journey centers on creating **Cognitive Synergy Architecture (CSA)** ‚Äî  
an ambitious framework designed to empower robots to act as **thinking partners**  
rather than mere tools. This architecture integrates semantic perception, cognitive planning,  
explainable control, multi-robot cooperation, and human-robot interaction (HRI)  
into one cohesive system.

Through **CSA**, I aim to realize robots capable of:  
- **Understanding the world in human-like terms** via semantic mapping and memory  
- **Planning adaptively** using self-regulation and meta-control strategies  
- **Executing safe and interpretable actions** through force-adaptive control and explainable AI  
- **Collaborating in multi-robot systems** using synchronized multimodal control  
- **Building shared understanding with humans** to foster trust and natural interaction  

My work involves:  
- Designing and implementing **ROS2-based modular systems**  
- Developing YOLOv5 + StrongSORT based **semantic perception pipelines**  
- Integrating **ORB-SLAM2** for precise pose estimation and environmental mapping  
- Building **Scene Graphs** to represent the environment in a machine-understandable ontology  
- Experimenting with real-time performance optimization, message passing, and synchronization  

This vision is not just academic ‚Äî it is tied to real-world implementation.  
At **Doosan Robotics**, I am actively engaged in Computer Vision, AI, and ROS training,  
refining my ability to translate theory into high-performance industrial solutions.

### Cognitive Synergy Architecture (CSA)

CSA (**Cognitive Synergy Architecture**) is not merely a research initiative ‚Äî  
it is the **core of my vision for robotics**. It embodies my belief that robots  
should not function as mere automated tools, but as **intelligent, thinking partners**  
capable of perceiving, planning, deciding, and collaborating like human co-workers.

#### ‚ö° CSA Objectives  
- Build robots that understand the world **semantically**, not just geometrically  
- Create systems that **adapt plans** in real-time using self-regulation and meta-control  
- Ensure **explainable, safe, and human-trustworthy control**  
- Enable **multi-robot cooperation** through synchronized perception and action  
- Achieve **seamless HRI** (Human-Robot Interaction) based on shared intentions and transparency  

#### ‚ö° CSA System Overview  
CSA is designed as a **5-stage architecture**:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Semantic Mapping & Memory** ‚Äî YOLOv5 + StrongSORT + ORB-SLAM2 pipeline,  
   generating semantic maps and scene graphs stored in scalable formats (JSON, Neo4j-ready).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Self-Planning & Meta-Control** ‚Äî combining learned policies (MLP, PPO)  
   with meta-controller logic for dynamic plan evaluation and adjustment.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explainable Control** ‚Äî integrating XAI (e.g., policy distillation, attention mechanisms)  
   to generate transparent, human-readable decision rationales.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Robot Execution** ‚Äî enabling multi-robot systems with real-time synchronization,  
   multimodal inputs, and collaborative task allocation.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **HRI & Common Ground** ‚Äî employing multimodal intent recognition (gesture, speech, gaze)  
   and feedback to build mutual understanding and trust in human-robot teams.  

#### ‚ö° CSA in Action  
- Full repository: [jack0682/CSAv1](https://github.com/jack0682/CSAv1.git)  
- Initial conceptual foundation:  
   - [_**"Towards Cognitive Collaborative Robots: Semantic-Level Integration and Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation"**_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03815)
   - [_**"Cognitive Synergy Architecture: SEGO for Human-Centric Collaborative Robots"**_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13149)
   - [_**Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control**_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19277)


These papers present the conceptual and theoretical foundation for **CSA (Cognitive Synergy Architecture)** ‚Äî  
a modular framework that integrates semantic perception (**SEGO**), intention-aware planning (**IMAGO**),  
and ontological reasoning with explainable control (**LOGOS**).

This architecture reflects **years of dedicated study, experimentation, and philosophical inquiry**.  
It is continuously evolving through hands-on implementation using ROS2 (Humble), Python,  
and real-world testing with RGB-D cameras, UR arms, and multi-robot simulators.

#### ‚ö° CSA is My purpose on my career  
CSA is not just a project ‚Äî it defines my **life mission** as a researcher and engineer.  
It represents my dedication to creating robots that:  
- Think alongside humans  
- Learn and adapt responsibly  
- Communicate their intentions clearly  
- Cooperate with empathy and precision
