# üõ†Ô∏è Oh Jaehong | Robotics & Control Engineer  

Driven by a relentless passion to merge mechanics, control theory, and artificial intelligence,  
I am pioneering the **Cognitive Synergy Architecture (CSA)**‚Äîa groundbreaking framework  
for human-centered collaborative robotics.  

Currently at the forefront of **Doosan Robotics training** in Computer Vision, AI, and ROS,  
I design systems where **robots become thinking partners, not just tools**.

## üë§ About Me  

- **Name:** Oh Jaehong (Ïò§Ïû¨Ìôç)  
- **Birthdate:** July 8, 1999  
- **Affiliation:** School of Mechanical Engineering, Soongsil University  
- **Current Role:** Robotics & Control Engineer, AI Researcher  

### üåü Research Vision  

My research journey centers on creating **Cognitive Synergy Architecture (CSA)** ‚Äî  
an ambitious framework designed to empower robots to act as **thinking partners**  
rather than mere tools. This architecture integrates semantic perception, cognitive planning,  
explainable control, multi-robot cooperation, and human-robot interaction (HRI)  
into one cohesive system.

Through **CSA**, I aim to realize robots capable of:  
- **Understanding the world in human-like terms** via semantic mapping and memory  
- **Planning adaptively** using self-regulation and meta-control strategies  
- **Executing safe and interpretable actions** through force-adaptive control and explainable AI  
- **Collaborating in multi-robot systems** using synchronized multimodal control  
- **Building shared understanding with humans** to foster trust and natural interaction  

My work involves:  
- Designing and implementing **ROS2-based modular systems**  
- Developing YOLOv5 + StrongSORT based **semantic perception pipelines**  
- Integrating **ORB-SLAM2** for precise pose estimation and environmental mapping  
- Building **Scene Graphs** to represent the environment in a machine-understandable ontology  
- Experimenting with real-time performance optimization, message passing, and synchronization  

This vision is not just academic ‚Äî it is tied to real-world implementation.  
At **Doosan Robotics**, I am actively engaged in Computer Vision, AI, and ROS training,  
refining my ability to translate theory into high-performance industrial solutions.
